# backupTool

* A basic incremental backup tool in C#
* Use : backupTool.exe C:\sourcefolder C:\destinationfolder
* It will copy the **content** of the folder, not the folder itself
* The backup is based on the filename and its last date/time write access.
* Can be used in a batch file and with a scheduled task easily

### To do

* more controls on the files
